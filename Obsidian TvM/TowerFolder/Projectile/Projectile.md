[[Tower]]
- **Purpose**: Manages the movement and collision detection of the projectile.
- **Components/Fields**:
    - `damage`: Amount of damage the projectile inflicts on enemies.
    - `speed`: Speed at which the projectile moves.
    - `enemyTag`: Tag assigned to enemy game objects.
    - `laneEndTag`: Tag assigned to lane ending game objects.
    - `lifeTimer`: Time before the projectile self-destructs.
- **Methods/Functions**:
    - `Update()`: Called every frame.
        - Calls `MoveStraight()` to move the projectile forward.
    - `MoveStraight()`: Moves the projectile forward in a straight line.
        - Translates the projectile's position in the forward direction by `speed` units per second multiplied by `Time.deltaTime`.
        - Decreases `lifeTimer` each frame, destroying the projectile if it reaches zero.
    - `OnCollisionEnter(Collision collision)`: Called when the projectile collides with another collider.
        - Checks if the collision's collider has the tag `enemyTag`.
            - If true:
                - Inflicts damage to the enemy by calling its `Damage()` method.
                - Destroys the projectile.
        - Checks if the collision's collider has the tag `laneEndTag`.
            - If true, destroys the projectile.
